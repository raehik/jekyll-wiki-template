Jekyll wiki template
====================

A Jekyll site template that makes it easier to develop a static [personal
wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki).


Why a personal wiki?
--------------------

I'm bad at remembering things. Worse, when I have lots of things to
remember, keeping them in my mind saps my concentration. Knowing this, I
occasionally write post-it notes or make small text files. But the
contents can be varied (I might want to write down some notes for a
game, or how to solve a common computer problem), and I didn't have a
central place to hold all those memos.

Enter the wiki. You can put all types of information and knowledge into
a central place and easily recall anything in it. My wiki template also
does lots of other useful things such as shortening common syntax (e.g.
linking to other wiki pages), generating a table of contents for each
page, and making frontmatter optional.


Usage
-----

Getting started with a new wiki is simple. Just clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/raehik/jekyll-wiki-template <site-dir>
    cd <site-dir>

Delete the .git directory:

    rm -rf .git

And you're good to go! You'll probably want to create a new Git
repository:

    git init

Now you're all set up with a new wiki in an empty repo.
